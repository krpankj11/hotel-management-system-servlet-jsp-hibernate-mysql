Project Description: Hotel Management System
Overview: The Hotel Management System (HMS) is a Java Servlet-based web application designed to streamline hotel management operations. The system provides distinct functionalities for three key user roles: Admin, Hotel Owner, and User. The Admin manages the overall system, including verifying hotel and hotel owner profiles. Hotel Owners can add hotels, view bookings, and manage their properties. Users can search for hotels, make bookings for themselves or others, and manage their reservations. The application aims to improve efficiency and enhance the user experience in the hotel booking and management process.
Key Features:
1. Admin Role:
* Profile Verification: Admins can review and verify the profiles of hotel owners and their establishments before they are listed in the system.
* Hotel Verification: Admins have the authority to verify newly added hotels to ensure they meet the platform's standards and criteria.
* Dashboard: Provides an overview of all registered hotels and hotel owners, including pending verification tasks and system statistics.

2. Hotel Owner Role:
* Hotel Management: Hotel owners can add new hotels to the system, including details such as name, location, amenities, room types, and pricing.
* Booking Management: Owners can view and manage all bookings made for their hotels, including checking in/out details, booking status, and guest information.
* Profile Management: Allows hotel owners to update their profile information, including contact details and hotel description.

3. User Role:
* Hotel Search: Users can search for hotels based on various criteria such as location, price range, and amenities.
* Booking: Users can book hotels for themselves or others. The system handles booking confirmations, cancellations, and modifications.
* Reservation Management: Users can view and manage their reservations, including checking booking status and making changes if necessary.

Technologies Used:
* Java Servlets: For handling HTTP requests and responses, implementing business logic, and managing user sessions.
* JSP (JavaServer Pages): For presenting dynamic web content and integrating with servlets to render the user interface.
* JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For interacting with the database to store and retrieve hotel, user, and booking information.
* MySQL: For the relational database management system to maintain data consistency and integrity.
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For creating a responsive and user-friendly front-end interface.

System Architecture:
* Client-Side: Web browser interface where users, hotel owners, and admins interact with the application.
* Server-Side: Java Servlets handle the backend logic, processing user requests and interacting with the database.
* Database Layer: MySQL database to store and manage hotel, user, and booking information, ensuring data persistence and retrieval.

Security Features:
* Authentication and Authorization: Secure login mechanisms for different user roles, ensuring that users have appropriate access to system functionalities.
* Data Validation: Input validation to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common security vulnerabilities.

User Experience:
* Intuitive Interface: The application offers an easy-to-navigate interface for all user roles, with clear options for managing profiles, hotels, and bookings.
* Responsive Design: The system is designed to be accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

Future Enhancements:
* Integration with Payment Gateways: To handle online payments and transactions securely.
* Advanced Search Filters: To enhance hotel search capabilities with more detailed filters.
* Mobile Application: Development of a mobile app version of the system for increased accessibilit
